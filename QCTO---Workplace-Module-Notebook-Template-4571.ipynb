    "1. Problem Statement:\n",
    "\n",
    "Access to clean and safe water is a fundamental human need, yet water pollution continues to pose a serious threat to ecosystems and human health worldwide. Industrial discharges, agricultural runoff, and domestic waste contribute significantly to the degradation of river water quality.\n",
    "\n",
    "The dataset River water parameters (1).csv contains various physicochemical parameters (such as pH, turbidity, dissolved oxygen, conductivity, hardness, nitrate, and temperature) collected from different sampling locations or times. However, without proper analysis, it is difficult to understand how these parameters interact and whether the water quality meets acceptable environmental and health standards.\n",
    "\n",
    "This project aims to analyze river water quality using data-driven techniques to identify patterns, detect possible contamination, and evaluate the suitability of water for different uses (e.g., drinking, agriculture, and aquatic life).\n",
    "\n",
    "\n",
    "2. Key problems to address include:\n",
    "\n",
    "Identifying trends and correlations between different water quality parameters.\n",
    "\n",
    "Detecting potential pollution or anomaly patterns in the river.\n",
    "\n",
    "Classifying the overall water quality (good, moderate, or poor) based on key indicators.\n",
    "\n",
    "Providing actionable insights for environmental monitoring and policy recommendations.\n",
    "\n",
    "3. Out of Scope\n",
    "\n",
    "Real-time monitoring or sensor integration (focus is on offline data analysis).\n",
    "\n",
    "Detailed chemical modeling of pollutant behavior beyond dataset parameters.\n",
    "\n",
    "Prediction of future water quality trends (only historical analysis)."
